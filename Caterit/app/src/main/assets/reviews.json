We heard a few hits from Les Miserables and other shows they were very good! Meal is quite rushed but great to experience an American diner so pretty much burgers...",

This is a tourist oriented place, very expensive ( $ 40 for an average Hamburger with French fries ). Nevertheless some of the waiters were very good singers For one time only, don't coming back.",
